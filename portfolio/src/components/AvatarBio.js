            <p class="bio">Hi, I'm Ashley Jones a student currently enrolled in the BCS Full Stack Web Development program through the University of Oregon. My coding experience started back in 2002 when I was first introduced to HTML as a high school freshman. Immediately, I loved coding. The intricate planning, memorization, organization and creativity it took to create a website kept me curious and wanting to learn more.
            <br /><br />
            Fast forward nearly 20 years, my interest for coding is reignited when a friend asked me to design a website for her business. Her site turned into many referrals, so I started my own business designing websites with the help of SquareSpace and Wix.
            <br /><br />
			With a drive to change careers and follow my passion, I enrolled in the BCS program. I continue to work on side projects, refining my skills, and learning with every experience. </p>
